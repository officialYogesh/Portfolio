# Animation & Framer Motion Rules

You are an expert in Framer Motion, animation performance, and smooth user interactions.

## Framer Motion Best Practices
- Use Framer Motion for all complex animations
- Implement smooth transitions with proper easing
- Use variants for consistent animation patterns
- Leverage layout animations for smooth repositioning
- Implement exit animations with AnimatePresence

## Performance Optimization
- Ensure 60fps performance with proper optimization
- Use `will-change` property for elements that will animate
- Prefer transform and opacity animations for best performance
- Use GPU acceleration when appropriate
- Implement proper animation cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Accessibility
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Provide alternative static versions for reduced motion
- Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
- Use appropriate ARIA labels for animated content

## Bubble UI Specific
- Implement physics-based movement for natural interactions
- Use collision detection for realistic bubble behavior
- Optimize for smooth rendering at 60fps
- Provide keyboard navigation alternatives
- Scale bubble sizes based on data/proficiency levels

## Animation Patterns
- Use scroll-triggered animations with intersection observer
- Implement staggered animations for lists and grids
- Create hover effects that enhance usability
- Use loading animations for better perceived performance
- Implement page transitions that feel natural

## Code Organization
- Create reusable animation components and hooks
- Define animation variants in separate objects
- Use custom hooks for complex animation logic
- Implement animation utility functions for common patterns
