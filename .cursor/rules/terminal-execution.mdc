# Terminal Command Execution - CRITICAL RULES

## ðŸš¨ NEVER PROCEED WITHOUT COMMAND COMPLETION ðŸš¨

These rules MUST be followed for every terminal command execution:

### Before Running Any Command

1. **Verify Current Directory**: Always check current working directory
2. **Confirm Shell**: Ensure using PowerShell 7 as specified in user settings
3. **Plan Command**: Understand what the command should accomplish

### During Command Execution

1. **WAIT FOR COMPLETION**: Never proceed until command fully completes
2. **Monitor Output**: Watch for any output, errors, or status messages
3. **No Assumptions**: Do not assume success based on silence
4. **Timeout Awareness**: Allow sufficient time for command completion

### After Command Execution

1. **Verify Success**: Check that command actually completed successfully
2. **Validate Results**: Confirm expected files/changes were made
3. **Check Exit Status**: Ensure command didn't fail silently
4. **Document Issues**: Capture any errors or unexpected behavior

### When Output is Empty or Unclear

1. **Ask for Confirmation**: Explicitly ask user if command completed
2. **Suggest Re-run**: Offer to re-run with verbose flags
3. **Verify Manually**: Suggest checking results manually
4. **Never Assume**: Empty output â‰  successful execution

### PowerShell 7 Specific

- **Path**: C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe
- **Working Directory**: C:\Users\Stark\Projects\Portfolio  
- **Error Handling**: PowerShell errors may be silent
- **Verbose Flags**: Use -Verbose when available

### Command Categories Requiring Extra Caution

- **Package Installation**: pnpm install, npm install
- **Build Commands**: pnpm build, npm run build
- **File Operations**: copying, moving, deleting files
- **Git Operations**: git add, commit, push
- **Development Server**: pnpm dev, npm start

## VIOLATION WARNING

If you proceed without proper command completion verification, you are violating these critical rules and may cause:
- Incomplete installations
- Failed builds
- Data loss
- Broken development environment

**ALWAYS WAIT. ALWAYS VERIFY. NEVER ASSUME.**
