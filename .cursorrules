# Quick Reference - Key Rules

## 🚨 CRITICAL PowerShell Execution Rules
- **NEVER PROCEED WITHOUT COMMAND COMPLETION CONFIRMATION**
- **ALWAYS WAIT** for PowerShell 7 command execution to complete fully
- **VERIFY ALL RESULTS** before moving to next steps
- **ERROR DIAGNOSIS** before suggesting alternatives

## 📋 Task Management
- Use **95% CERTAINTY RULE** - only suggest changes when >95% sure
- Reference task numbers from TASKS.md when working on specific features
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS** - ask for clarification when uncertain

## 🎯 Main Interactive Loop
After completing tasks:
1. Run `python userinput.py` 
2. Read user input from terminal
3. Perform next tasks based on input
4. Repeat until user enters "stop"

## 💻 Tech Stack Standards
- **Next.js 15.x** App Router with RSC
- **TypeScript** strict mode with proper interfaces  
- **Tailwind CSS 4.x** utility-first approach
- **Framer Motion** for animations (60fps target)
- **7 Color Themes** with CSS custom properties

## 🎨 Portfolio Requirements  
- **Multi-theme system** (Dracula, One Dark, Nord, Gruvbox, Solarized Dark, Horizon, Palenight)
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** across all themes
- **Lighthouse 95+** for all categories
- **Content management** via config files only
- **Performance**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1

## 📁 File Organization
- `/config/` - All hardcoded content and configuration
- `/src/app/` - Next.js 15 App Router structure  
- `/src/components/` - Organized by feature and reusability
- **Lowercase with dashes** for directories

## ✅ Quality Gates
- Linting, type checking, and basic tests before committing
- Full test suite and performance audit before deploying  
- Test all features with each theme variant
- Verify mobile responsiveness and accessibility

Remember: **Certainty over speed** - ask when uncertain, verify before proceeding!
