## Recent Improvements (Current Session)

### ✅ Framer Motion Deprecation Fix & UI Improvements (January 2025)

**🔧 Fixed Critical Framer Motion Deprecation Issue & Blank Page Glitch**:

- **Problem**: Home page going blank when revisiting from other pages due to `motion() is deprecated. Use motion.create() instead.` error and subsequent type complexities in `AnimatedContainer.tsx`. Featured Projects section also appeared blank on page revisits.
- **Root Cause**: Incorrectly using deprecated `motion(Component)` syntax and overly complex type handling for dynamic components in Framer Motion v12.15.0.
- **Solution**: Refactored `AnimatedContainer.tsx` to always use `motion.div` as the primary animator and use the `as` prop for a nested, non-animated semantic element.
- **Implementation**:
  - `AnimatedContainer` now wraps children in `motion.div`.
  - The `as` prop specifies the tag of an inner component rendered inside `motion.div`.
  - This simplifies type inference and ensures motion context is consistently applied.
- **Result**: Eliminated blank page/section issues, removed console deprecation warnings, and ensured stable animation behavior on navigation.

**📱 Enhanced Home Page Layout**:

- **Improved CTA Button Spacing**: Increased margin above "View Resume" and "Contact Me" buttons by adding `mt-8` to their wrapping `div` for better visual separation.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused `AccentButton` import to fix ESLint warnings
- **Build Optimization**: Verified clean TypeScript compilation and successful production builds

- **Animation System**: Fully functional with improved compatibility

**📈 Performance Impact**:

- **Eliminated Runtime Errors**: No more motion deprecation warnings
- **Stable Navigation**: Fixed blank page issue when revisiting home from other pages
- **Maintained Animations**: All scroll-triggered animations working correctly
- **Build Size**: Maintained efficient 15 kB main page bundle size

  - Bubbles now have diverse sizes independent of proficiency levels for more visual interest
  - Random size assignment creates organic, natural-looking clusters matching the inspiration design

- **Aesthetic Empty Bubbles**:

  - Added `aestheticBubbles` prop (default: 4) to include empty colored bubbles for visual appeal
  - Empty bubbles use random category colors and varied sizes but contain no text/icons
  - Creates better visual balance and matches the design aesthetic of the reference image

- **Harmonious Theme-Blending Colors**:

  - Updated `getCategoryThemeColor` to use a palette of softer, related HSL values (blues, purples, teals with varying lightness/saturation).
  - Ensured bubble colors blend naturally with the overall website theme, similar to the monochrome-plus-accent style in the Dribbble screenshot.

- **Clean Icon and Text Styling**:

  - Icons and skill names now use a solid contrasting color (e.g., white) for maximum readability against bubble backgrounds.
  - Removed `textShadow` and `filter` properties from text elements within bubbles.
