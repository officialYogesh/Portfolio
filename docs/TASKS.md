### ‚úÖ Framer Motion Deprecation Fix & UI Improvements (January 2025)

**üîß Fixed Critical Framer Motion Deprecation Issue & Blank Page Glitch**:

- **Problem**: Home page going blank when revisiting from other pages due to `motion() is deprecated. Use motion.create() instead.` error and subsequent type complexities in `AnimatedContainer.tsx`. Featured Projects section also appeared blank on page revisits.
- **Root Cause**: Incorrectly using deprecated `motion(Component)` syntax and overly complex type handling for dynamic components in Framer Motion v12.15.0. This affected both `AnimatedContainer` and `StaggerItem`.
- **Solution**: Refactored `AnimatedContainer.tsx` and `StaggerItem` (in `StaggerContainer.tsx`) to always use `motion.div` as the primary animator and use the `as` prop for a nested, non-animated semantic element.
- **Implementation**:
  - `AnimatedContainer` and `StaggerItem` now wrap children in `motion.div`.
  - The `as` prop specifies the tag of an inner component rendered inside `motion.div`.
  - This simplifies type inference and ensures motion context is consistently applied.
- **Result**: Eliminated blank page/section issues, removed console deprecation warnings, and ensured stable animation behavior on navigation.

**üì± Enhanced Home Page Layout & Project Card Cleanup**:

- **Improved CTA Button Spacing**: Increased margin above "View Resume" and "Contact Me" buttons by adding `mt-8` to their wrapping `div` for better visual separation.
